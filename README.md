dream
=====

 Peace, peace! he is not dead, he doth not sleep—	
  
  He hath awakened from the **dream** of life—	
  
  ’Tis we, who lost in stormy visions, keep
  
  With phantoms an unprofitable strife,	
  
  And in mad trance, strike with our spirit’s knife	
  
  Invulnerable nothings.—We decay	
  
  Like corpses in a charnel; fear and grief	
  
  Convulse us and consume us day by day,

And cold hopes swarm like worms within our living clay.
